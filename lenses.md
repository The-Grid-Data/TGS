# Formalized Description for LLM Processing: Lenses at The Grid

This document outlines the concepts utilized at The Grid for collecting information online using specific lenses. These concepts are designed to guide the Large Language Model (LLM) in effectively searching and processing relevant information. The notion of a lens, inspired by the story model from Andrew Harrison, serves as a framework to capture pertinent data for users.

## Overview of Lenses

At The Grid, a lens is a conceptual tool used to generalize and organize the information relevant to a user. This approach follows first principles thinking to ensure clarity and precision. Currently, there are five primary lenses used at The Grid:

1. **Profile**
2. **Products**
3. **Assets**
4. **Entity**
5. **Socials**

## Detailed Lens Descriptions

### Profile Lens
The Profile lens captures comprehensive information about an entity’s offerings and fundamental characteristics. This includes:

- Services or products offered
- Business activities
- Supported currencies
- Real-world identifiers

**Example Scenarios:**
- **Investor Perspective (Jerry):** Jerry, an investor, views a store through the Profile lens to evaluate investment opportunities. He gathers information such as:
  - What products or services are offered?
  - What activities does the business engage in?
  - What currencies are accepted?
  - Are there any real-world identifiers associated with the business?
- **Regulatory Perspective (Caren):** Caren, representing EU regulatory frameworks, examines the profiles to ensure compliance. She looks for:
  - Clear descriptions of products and services
  - Business activities and their alignment with regulations
  - Supported currencies for financial transparency

### Products Lens
The Products lens focuses on detailed information about individual products available within an entity. This includes:

- Product functions and features
- Descriptions and self-representations
- Compatibility with other products

**Example Scenarios:**
- **Software Engineer Perspective (Jerry):** Jerry, a software engineer, uses the Products lens to gather technical information. He explores:
  - Detailed functions and features of the products
  - Technical descriptions and specifications
  - Interoperability and compatibility with other systems or products
- **Investor Perspective (Jerry):** Jerry evaluates the technical robustness and market potential of products by examining:
  - The functionality and innovation of the products
  - Technical specifications that might affect scalability and performance
  - Compatibility with existing market solutions

### Assets Lens
The Assets lens deals with financial and digital assets associated with an entity. This includes:

- Supported currencies and assets
- Issued assets by the entity
- Network compatibility of the assets

**Example Scenarios:**
- **Investor Perspective (Jerry):** Jerry assesses the financial health and investment potential by analyzing:
  - The types of currencies and assets supported
  - Whether the entity has issued its own assets and their performance
  - Network compatibility which might impact asset liquidity and transferability
- **Regulatory Perspective (Caren):** Caren ensures compliance with financial regulations by investigating:
  - The types of assets and currencies supported
  - The issuance of assets by the entity and adherence to regulatory standards
  - Network compatibility and security protocols

### Entity Lens
The Entity lens verifies the legitimacy and official status of a business entity. This includes:

- Local registration details
- Organizational structure
- Licenses and regulatory compliance

**Example Scenarios:**
- **Investor Perspective (Jerry):** Jerry confirms the credibility and stability of a potential investment by checking:
  - The business’s local registration details
  - Its organizational structure and governance
  - Licenses and regulatory compliance to mitigate risk
- **Regulatory Perspective (Caren):** Caren ensures the entity operates within legal frameworks by examining:
  - Accurate local registration details
  - The organizational structure for transparency
  - Necessary licenses and adherence to EU regulations

### Socials Lens
The Socials lens compiles information about an entity’s presence and activities on various online social platforms. This includes:

- Social media accounts (e.g., Facebook, Twitter)
- Professional networks (e.g., LinkedIn)
- Developer platforms (e.g., GitHub)
- Other relevant online presences

**Example Scenarios:**
- **Investor Perspective (Jerry):** Jerry examines the entity’s online presence and engagement by reviewing:
  - Active social media accounts and their followers
  - Contributions to professional networks and industry discussions
  - Developer activities on platforms like GitHub, indicating technical prowess and community involvement
- **Software Engineer Perspective (Jerry):** Jerry seeks technical insights and community feedback by exploring:
  - Code repositories and contributions on GitHub
  - Technical discussions and support on forums and professional networks
  - Social media interactions related to technical projects and updates
- **Regulatory Perspective (Caren):** Caren ensures that the entity’s online activities align with regulatory standards by checking:
  - Compliance with advertising and information dissemination regulations on social media
  - Transparency and accountability in online communications
  - Presence on recognized and reputable platforms

By utilizing these lenses, The Grid aims to systematically collect and process relevant information to enhance user experience, ensure data accuracy, and support various user roles, including investors, technical professionals, and regulatory representatives.
