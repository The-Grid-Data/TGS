# profiles.urlBlog

Table: ```Profile```

Name: ```Blog URL```

Parameter ID: ```profiles.urlBlog```

Type: ```URL```

Specifications: 

Description: ```Link to the root of the Profile’s page for content```

Validation steps: ```The URL is for the website with the most published content that does not focus on the Profile’s services or operations. The text or content on the website will often have opinions and announcements concerning the Profile, its Sector, and its Subsector. If the Profile appears to have more than one blog (e.g. a news subpage on their website and a Medium page), choose the blog that has the most recently published content.```

In DBD: ```True```

Notes: ```The purpose of this field is for people to learn more about the content that a Profile is creating. Some companies will have a blog page on their website, but they may publish more frequently somewhere else for distribution purposes. Many companies also have a “news” page, which consolidates content such as articles, podcasts, press releases, and product announcements.```
