Type: ```Link to another Table```

Specifications: ```Asset - Type / Standard```

Description: ```What type of representation of value is this?```

Validation steps: ```If the asset is primarily used for payment or investment purposes, then it is a Currency. If the asset is a collection of unique tokens (usually representing a form of media such as art, images, music or writing), then it is an NFT. If it is a token required to make decisions about a protocol or within an entity, then it is a Governance asset. If the token is required to take action within a certain system (such as redeeming services or claiming benefits), then it is a Utility asset. If the asset is often pegged to a fiat currency or traditional commodity, then it is a Stablecoin. If the token is clearly marked to represent a fungible financial instrument (but not a fiat currency or traditional commodity), it is a Security. If the asset has little to no utility and has “fun” as part of its purpose, then it is a Meme.```
